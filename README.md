# CKAD-Exam-Experienced-Sharing

 This is my experience on the CKAD exam. I will share with you my learning path and some useful tips and tricks. CKAD is my first practical hands-on exam on the way of my journey. BTW, during the exam, I am so excited for 30 min and I flag most of the questions. The reason for excitement is electricity. At this time, EPC is cut off the electricity by doing unplan. Okay, let's start my learning path. First I learned 

- the [Docker for the Absolute Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo&t=2286s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) from YouTube
- Complete Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners [Techworld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnvRFRk_51k&list=PLy7NrYWoggjziYQIDorlXjTvvwweTYoNC&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana)  
- the **official course** [Kubernetes for Developer](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/kubernetes-for-developers-lfd259) from the Linux Foundation
- the CKAD course from [Mumshad Mannambeth](https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/)'s course


 Now, you just need " **Practice!** **Practice!** **Practice!** by doing hands-on during the studying. Kubernetes exams are practical hands-on. So, you just need to do hands-on experiences daily. If you are not working with Kubernetes, you can family some scenario hands-on with Kubernetes in [KodeKloud-Engineer](https://kodekloud.com/kodekloud-engineer/) when your level is in Senior [DevOps Engineer]() in this playground. You can **Sign Up** for free and play it. If else, you are working on real Kubernetes Projects, that is a perfect way for you. If so, You just need to do to register for the exam. I also check up on these GitHub practice samples!

Here are some GitHub links that I learned
- [Dgkanatsios](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises)
- [NileshGule](https://github.com/NileshGule/ckad-exam-prep)
- [Dennyzhang](https://github.com/dennyzhang/cheatsheet-kubernetes-A4)
- [Ahmetb](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes)'s Network Policies ( I don't even practice it. You will be asked about that Network Policies)

 Now, register and test your hardware checklist for Internet Bandwidth, WebCam, Microphone and clean Room with Desk, etc.. in PSI or [this](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/lf-cert-agreement/) [link](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/tips-cka-and-ckad). You need to read the Exam Documentation once after you register for your CKAD exam. When you register exam, you will access [killer.sh](https://killer.sh/) with 2 sessions. It is enough to prepare for your CKAD exam. Killer.sh is harder than a real exam. If you passed with a high mark within one time in killer.sh, you will get a lot of confidence and experience from this. **Killer.sh** is awesome! When I try this first time, I only got 32 marks during exam hours (2 hours). Some exam prerequisites are needed to practice. After 2nd and 3rd times, I complete with High marks (126/126). I highly recommend practicing with fast typing when you sit in **killer.sh**. The next highly recommended is to use in vim or vi editor like a professional. This [vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knyJt8d6C_8&ab_channel=TheFrontOpsGuy) course is useful for me! I hope you also. Exam questions are under curriculum! Don't worry! It's fair!


During exam, 
- Verify that you switched the correct context. If you didn't switch the correct context (given), you will get zero! Verify!!! Verify !!! Verify!!!
- Time management is key. So, try to use imperative commands as possible as
- Don't panic when you are stuck in some questions. Flag it and come back when you know some insightful idea
- Don't hurry up in reading questions! Need to create namespace or not?, need to add env?, labels? Always verify your results after you create or deploy something!
- Try to use **Vim** or **Vi** editor as a professional (practice daily usage before exam)
- Bookmark useful official Kubernetes's Document in the web browser
(During the exam, I can't forward [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) official site! The proctor didn't allow me!)
- Sleep enough and relax your mind before the exam but I sit the exam, morning 1:00 AM! Ha Ha!!! 

Yeah!!! It's enough for preparing for your CKAD exam! If I need some information, please tell me! I will add it! Good Luck with your exam! Trust yourself!!! You can do it!!! Bye Now!!!
